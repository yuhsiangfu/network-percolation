# Network Percolation
Simulate the percolation on theoretical networks including a regular network, a random network, a scale-free network and a small-world network.<br />

## Theoretical Network Generator
In this code, it will generate four theoretical networks including a regular network, a random network, a scale-free network and a small-world network.

## Network Percolation
In this code, the percolation will be simulated on the theoretical networks.<br />

## Percolation Results Visualization
In this code, the percolation results of theoretical networks will be visualized in a curve figure.<br />
